 <li>A vertex <em>v </em>in an undirected graph <em>G </em>is an <em>odd cycle transversal </em>if every cycle of odd length in <em>G </em>contains the vertex <em>v</em>. Develop a linear-time algorithm for the following problem: given a graph <em>G </em>and a vertex <em>v </em>in <em>G</em>, decide if <em>v </em>is an odd cycle transversal.</li>

 <li>Suppose that each class <em>C<sub>i </sub></em>has an enrollment <em>r<sub>i </sub></em>while each classroom <em>R<sub>j </sub></em>has a capacity <em>c<sub>j</sub></em>. A classroom <em>R<sub>j </sub></em>is “feasible” for a class <em>C<sub>i </sub></em>if <em>c<sub>j</sub>/</em>2 ≤ <em>r<sub>i </sub></em>≤ <em>c<sub>j</sub></em>. Develop an efficient algorithm that, on a set of classes (with enrollments given) and a set of classrooms (with capacities given), make a feasible assignment of the classes to the classrooms such that the as many classes as possible can get held starting at 9am on Monday.</li>

 <li>Suppose that in addition to edge capacities, a flow network also has <em>vertex capacities</em>, i.e., each vertex <em>v </em>has a limit <em>c</em>(<em>v</em>) on how much flow can pass through <em>v</em>. Show how to transform a flow network <em>G </em>= (<em>V,E</em>) with vertex capacities into a flow network <em>G</em><sup>0 </sup>= (<em>V </em><sup>0</sup><em>,E</em><sup>0</sup>) without vertex capacities, such that a maximum flow in <em>G</em><sup>0 </sup>has the same value as a maximum flow in <em>G</em>.</li>

 <li>(Textbook, page 731, Question 26.2-10) Show how to find a maximum flow in a flow network <em>G </em>= (<em>V,E</em>) by a sequence of at |<em>E</em>| augmenting paths. (<em>Hint</em>: determine the paths <em>after </em>finding the maximum flow.)</li>
